## ⚡ Next Step
When you push this repo to GitHub, set the description to the shortened version and include the **Authors section** in your README. That way, anyone viewing the project knows it’s a collaboration between you and Narenselvan28.

👉 Do you want me to also help you **draft a “Features + Demo” section** for the README, so buyers can quickly see what the webpage looks like and what it offers? That would make it easier to market or sell.
